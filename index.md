##So, here we are...

You have stumbled upon the personal portfolio and record of musings of Dom O'Connell. If you have arrived here by accident, apologies, why don't you have a quick scoot around anyway. You never know, you might like what you read - maybe.


##What?

There are two main purposes here:

###1. Portfolio / Employment Record
I am a web developer by trade, so this serves as a portfolio of some parts of my recent work. And to show where I have worked in the past.

###2. Musings
I hate the word "blog". An entirely useless collection of thoughts that will entice the interest of such a small percentage of the population that its very existence is barely justified.

I will write here on an ad-hoc basis, if and when something happens that I deem to be worthy to write about, and remember to do so.
