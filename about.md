## Here we go, all about me - Dom O'Connell

### Personal Details
My name is Dom O'Connell, <span class="myage"></span>, from {{ site.livein }}.

###Personal Information
I have been happily married to my wife, Samantha, since I was 21. I love my family, my friends, my wife and my God. I am a Christian, and my current home church is Everyday Champions Church in Newark.

###Interests & Hobbies
I often spend my recreational time writing code and building projects. I love learning new skills relevant to my work. I find it incredibly satisfactory to learn how to do something new, so that's what I spend my time doing.

I'm also a "tech geek". Enjoy live production; lighting, sound, video etc. I volunteer on the production team at church, mostly doing lighting.

Other than that I enjoy films, and socialising - not that that's particularly unique to me of course.

I'd like to be a "gamer" - but I find it too boring.

###Work
I am fortunate enough to be in a job that reflects my interests. I thoroughly enjoy writing code, solving problems and helping build useful tools that people enjoy using. There is more on my work and employment here [Employment](/employment) and here [Portfolio](/portfolio).
