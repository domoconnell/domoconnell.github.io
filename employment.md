# January 2015 ~ Present
**Company:** Conical Software Ltd

**Position:** Web Developer, User Interface Creator & Director

**Key Skills**<br>
HTML &bull;
Javascript &bull;
CSS &bull;
Angular &bull;
jQuery &bull;
NodeJS &bull;
Swift

**Responsibilities**<br>
It is my job to build nice looking interfaces for the software we build. My role is not a *graphic designer*, but a UI designer. The interfaces I design need to be well thought out, intuitive and promote user adoption. I have to think about the entire user experience, and the process a user has to go through to complete various tasks. The UIs we build interact with a RESTful API designed by other guys in the team.

I also build mobile apps for iOS, these often communicate with the very same APIs as our web front end software.


#August 2011 ~ October 2014
**Company:** Divine Ideas Ltd

**Position:** Web Developer/Designer & Director

**Key Skills**<br>
PHP &bull; 
Codeigniter &bull;
HTML &bull;
Javascript &bull;
CSS &bull;
jQuery &bull;
NodeJS &bull;
Sever Management &bull;
Cordova

**Responsibilities**<br>
It was my job to design and build complex management systems. We built several systems, the main one of which was a church management system. It was my responsibility to design the structure of the system, and the servers that it ran on. As the systems grew bigger, my job evolved more into front-end development, as more people were employed to manage the servers and develop the backend, although I still helped develop the backend systems.

The church management software grew to be quite big, so we separated out the separate parts and built several smaller systems that communicated with each other in a variety of ways.

Whilst at Divine we also engaged in several other projects, including:

* Joomla Websites
* Magento Websites
* Cordova Hybrid Apps

**Company:** Everyday Champions Center

**Position:** Conference Staff & Internship Participant

**Key Skills**<br>
Conference Organisation &bull; 
Website Building/Maintenance &bull; 
General IT Support

**Responsibilities**<br>
Primarily I was taking part in the internship program run by the church. This included Bible study, essay writing and lots of reading. I also volunteered as conference staff to help out with the day-to-day running of the centre. This included booking and organising conference clients, maintaining the website, and general IT support for staff. It was during this year that I first started to build the church management system that later turned into Divine Ideas.
